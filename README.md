# Simple NodeJs WebServer

For my training to NodeJs, I have create a simple NodeJs WebServer for renderred all HTML/JS WebSites in a folder.

How that work ?

In the root path you have a folder named "sites", in this folder you can create a folder with your HTML/JS/CSS files.
When you start the NodeJs server.js, an index.html will be generated in the "sites" folder.
```sh
$ node server.js
```
You juste have to go on the NodeJS server default URI on port 2704 and you will show yous folders with your differents sites.
[http://localhost:2704](http://localhost:2704).
This project it's juste a POC for now but i will made some update to clean the code and made something better.
